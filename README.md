# Pysualize
Terminal-base music visualizer

## Goals
* Show gradient background in the terminal while running (✔️)
* Make the background dynamic (How?)
* Embed lyrics of the music in the terminal (Working on...) -> get_gradient_background_with_text function vs embed_character_in_background function
* Translate it for the faster running (How?)
* After completing those goals, let's add some special features like changing text colors, make text appear/disappear effect etc...
