# Pysualize
Terminal-base music visualizer

## Goals
* Show gradient background in the terminal while running (✔️)
* Make the background dynamic (How?)
* Embed lyrics of the music in the terminal (Working on...) -> embed_character_in_background function to embed ASCII art made by text2art function from the art external module
* Translate it for the faster running (How?)
* After completing those goals, let's add some special features like changing text colors, making text appear/disappear effect, etc...

## External modules
* [art](https://github.com/sepandhaghighi/art)
* [colour](https://github.com/vaab/colour)
